# Aniworld Scraper

Scraper for the Anime Hoster Aniworld. 

This tool will download all Seasons and Episodes of an anime from Aniworld.to

How to use:
* Clone the Repo
* pip install requirements.txt
* Change anime_name in start_app to your anime name (Format -> see URL of the anime)
* INFO: GUtils is a self writen library. I used it here as a Logging handler. If you don't trust me remove all logger.X
and replace them with print. 
* If you now start the start_app.py a small chrome window will open everytime it finds a Episode. This is for the Google Captcha!
* If the Captcha aperas please solve it. If you close the window you have to restart the application.
